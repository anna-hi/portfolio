          During our beginning meetings with Mark, we saw firsthand how tedious
          and tiring it was for faculty to fill out these forms. Most faculty
          chose to fill out the form all at once by trying to remember
          activities they did off the top of their head.
        </p>
        <p>
          This made it extremely difficult to categorize their activities into

          back and forth between the different pages.
