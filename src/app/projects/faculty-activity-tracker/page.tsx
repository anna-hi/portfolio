            Every year, the College of Media Arts and Design &#40;CAMD&#41;
            faculty must fill out an <b>exhausting 10-page paper form</b> to
            track their completed activities to earn merit. The Merit Committee
            then sorts through <b>100s of forms</b> to approve activities and
            manually assign scores.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tedious process led our client, Mark Sivak, head of the Merit
            Committee, to task us to create a digital solution to streamline the
            process.

        <p>
          During our beginning meetings with Mark, we saw firsthand how tedious
          and tiring it was for faculty to fill out these forms. Most faculty
          chose to fill out the form all at once by trying to remember
          activities they did off the top of their head.
        </p>
        <p>
          This made it extremely difficult to categorize their activities into
          the 3 main categories. Filling out the form involved a lot of flipping
          back and forth between the different pages.
