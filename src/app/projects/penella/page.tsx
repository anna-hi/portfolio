      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Penella or Pen-ella is a classroom project-built from my own
        imagination. Bibbity boppity boo! The name is inspired by Cinderella,
        otherwise known as Cinder-ella. Penella is a journalling website unlike
        any other, given its customizable nature and additional features such as
        a calendar moodboard, gifs, and stickers.
