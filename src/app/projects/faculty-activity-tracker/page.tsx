            Every year, the College of Media Arts and Design (CAMD) faculty must
            fill out an <strong>exhausting 10-page paper form</strong> to track
            their completed activities to earn merit. The Merit Committee then
            sorts through <strong>100s of forms</strong> to approve activities
            and manually assign scores.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tedious process led our client, Mark Sivak, head of the Merit
            Committee, to task us to create a digital solution to streamline the
            process.

        Throughout the spring, summer, and fall 2023 semesters in Sandbox(a
        student-led software consultancy), I was a UI/UX designer for my client,
        Mark Sivak, the head of the Merit Committee.

        &quot;Faculty Activity Tracker&quot; is a website that digitizes a
        previously 10-page paper form that hundreds of faculty from the College
        of Media Arts and Design (CAMD) at Northeastern must fill out every year
        to track the activities theyâ€™ve completed to earn merit. Additionally,
        this website also provides the Merit Committee with a simpler and
        digital scoring system. Currently, this form is taxing to fill out and
        an arduous task for the 10-member Merit Committee to manually assign
        scores to.
