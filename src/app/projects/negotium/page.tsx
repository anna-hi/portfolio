            I worked as a Product Designer at CoEx Lab within the Human Computer
            Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. More
            specifically, I contributed to <b>Negotium</b>, a mobile app{" "}
            <b>designed for women, by women</b> to teach negotiation skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            During our time on the project, the other designer and I created a
            negotiation practice feature equipped with real-time calls, LLM and
            AI-based chat practice, and a negotiation game.

          As a starting point, the past designer had conducted a diary study
          resulting in a list of design and content issues. We selected high
          priority issues and then generated &ldquo;how-might-we&apos;s&rdquo;{" "}
          <b>using Miro</b> to frame the individual challenges.

          From our &ldquo;how-might-we&apos;s&rdquo;, we determined that the one
          above would be most impactful to the application and ideated upon
          them.

            Sopu &#40;the most similar app to Negotium&#41; had a negotiation
            practice feature available, but with some key issues: the{" "}

            For italki, most of the features were locked behind pay walls, but
            they offered more <b>community engagement via a forum</b> where
            people could post a variety of content.

              my sketches.
